# Monster Clicker Idle Game

Click on the enemies to siphon their gold, and on win take the rest of their gold. Buying `properties` will make it so you can earn gold without clicking, the more you have the faster they will work.

## Chests and Items

Buying chests will give you `Items`. Each `Item` has it's own effects. The `Items` do stack, so the more you have, the more effective their effects are.

## Properties

Buying properties will make you `Idle Gold`. Every 33 milliseconds you will earn `Idle Gold` and if the site is closed if will calculate how much you would've earned if you were playing. The cheaper they are, the less they produce.

### Future/Roadmap

[] Adding more items and their functionalities
I plan on adding way more items in the future that all do vastly different things, and aren't boring as the current 5 i have now
[] UI changes
It's impossible to currently know what the items do, how much damage properties deal, and some other basic stats. I plan on adding a way for you to see all of that.
